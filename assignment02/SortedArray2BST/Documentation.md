## Task 1: Code Coverage
<!-- In this task, you are required to achieve the highest possible (ideally, 100\%) line coverage. for the provided Java solutions. Utilize the [JaCoCo] plugin to analyze and generate coverage reports.  -->


## Task 2: Designing Contracts
<!-- - For the provided Java solutions, design and document contracts including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants.
- Implement the contracts in Java solution code and write tests to verify that the contracts are enforced at runtime. Define appropriate pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants for each provided Java solution. Incorporate the designed contracts into the source codes. For invariants, ensure they are checked at the start and end of each public method or after any state-changing operation. -->

### Pre-conditions

### Post-conditions


### Invariants


## Task 3: Testing Contracts
<!-- Develop a suite of JUnit tests specifically aimed at verifying that the contracts are correctly enforced. This should include tests that:
- Validate normal operation when pre-conditions are met.
- Confirm that appropriate exceptions or errors are thrown when pre-conditions are violated.
- Ensure post-conditions hold after the execution of functions under various conditions.
- Verify that invariants are maintained throughout the software module's lifecycle, especially after state changes. -->

### Tests for pre-conditions


### Tests for post-conditions



## Task 4: Property-Based Testing
<!-- - Use **property-based testing** techniques to derive tests for the provided Java solutions.
- Identify properties that should hold true for any inputs and document your rationale.
- Use a property-based testing framework to automate the testing process. 
- hint: Add jqwik framework to Your pom.xml -->
